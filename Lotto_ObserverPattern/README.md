# Lotto

This was a class project using the Observer Pattern with a Simple Lotto system.

## Player info
Their name, numbers chosen and budget.

## Lotto info
Numbers are picked at random.
Each number costs $1 to purchase.

## Sequence of events
The program welcomes the players listed and then gives an option to run the game for the "week".

A random number is rolled and the players are notified whether they have won or not and their remaining budget and the program repeats from the start of the sequence until a player wins or all players run out of money.
