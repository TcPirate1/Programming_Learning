# Repository for projects used to learn coding & programming

Repository contains a mixture of GUI programs and non-GUI programs.

Each folder will have a readme in them.

Also please excuse any comments with paragraphs in them. This was a requirement for some class assessements
and is not part of my normal practice!

## Which ones are for which language?
Basically all files that aren't in folders are Python files
and the ones in folders are C#.

The exception is the rock_paper_scissors game which is a Python based game.

## Which ones have a GUI (Graphical User Interface)?
- [x] rock_paper_scissors
- [x] Calculator.pyw

## BingoGame.py

Basic Bingo game with a randomized list of numbers for the player's bingo card.
When the player inputs the correct number it will be removed from the bingo card, if they do not then it will return text saying it was incorrect.
When the bingo card is empty the game will finish.

## BoxCalculator.py

A calculator using modulus to calculate how many boxes are required to fit all the items specified by user input E.g. if input is 13, the program will tell them they need X amount of big, medium or small boxes to hold their 13 items.

Big boxes can hold 5 items. Medium Boxes can hold 3 and Small Boxes can hold 1.

## Calculator.pyw

A GUI calculator for performing basic arithmetic functions with an in-built converter for inches to centimeters and vice versa as well.
There are 3 clear buttons as well one clears both output boxes and one that clears the output for the converter box only and another that clears only the arithmetic output box.

## GradeCalculator.py

A program that outputs the user's grade where the *Final grade* is equal to half of the *Project grade* and their *Exam grade* added together. The grade is based on a series of if else statements.
