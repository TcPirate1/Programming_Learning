# Repository for projects used to learn coding & programming

Repository contains a mixture of GUI programs and non-GUI programs

Have not finished creating readme's for the folders yet

Also please excuse any comments with paragraphs in them. This was a requirement for some class assessements
and is not part of my normal practice!

## Which ones are for which language?
Basically all files that aren't in folders are Python files
and the ones in folders are C#.

The exception is the rock_paper_scissors game which is a Python based game.

## Which ones have a GUI (Graphical User Interface)?
- [x] rock_paper_scissors
- [x] Calculator.pyw
