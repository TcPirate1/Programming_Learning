# Ticketing System
Non-GUI Mock Ticketing system program made in C# for the end of year assignment of a Programming Class.

Can accept user input and handle some empty fields if the user does not know the answer to them.

Can 'change' a staff's password if the issue is given in the issue input.

The 'IT Support' user can change aspects of the ticket.

Can summarize the amount of tickets in the system.

## Scenario
The program took in User Input from 'staff' and sending that input to the 'IT Support', who can then reply to the ticket when the job is done.
The program can also output the statistic of the tickets.

## User Inputs
'Staff' could input their Name, Staff ID, Email and Issue.

'IT Support' could change Team Response and Ticket Status.

## Constraints
The events happen one after another. 'Staff' and 'IT Support' are not really seperated.
