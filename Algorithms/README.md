# Algorithms

Each folder contains an algorithm that was studied in class and needed a program written based on what it was.

## Bubble

A study on the Bubble sorting algorithm and assignment required us to use this to sort a list of people by their rating and then their names by iterating through the list.

## BuiltIn

Timing the built in C# .Net Array sorting function to see how fast it is compared to Quick sort in sorting a list of category items.

## Quick

THe assignment required us to write a Quick Sort for the same list of category items from BuiltIn by creating a "pivot" to speed up the sorting.

This sorting was also timed to compare with BuiltIn method of sorting.
